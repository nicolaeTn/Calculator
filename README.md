# Calculator
This is a basic calculator implemented in Java using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The UI was designed using Java SWT. 
It supports operations such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division, and raising a number to some power. 
The order of operations is ensured by using a technique involving four stacks.

To run the project, simply run Driver.java that contains the main method.
